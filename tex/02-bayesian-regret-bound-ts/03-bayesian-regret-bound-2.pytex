Let us now impose a specific form of confidence bounds:

\begin{align*}
L_t(a) &= \max \left\{0, \hat\mu_t(a) - \sqrt{\frac{2 + 6\log T}{n_t(a)}}\right\} \\
U_t(a) &= \min \left\{1, \hat\mu_t(a) + \sqrt{\frac{2 + 6\log T}{n_t(a)}}\right\}
\end{align*}

where $\hat\mu_t(a)$ is the mean of rewards received playing action $a$ before time $t$, and $n_t(a)$ is the number of times action $a$ was played before time $t$.
(If action $a$ has never been played at time $t$, $L_t(a) = 0$ and $U_t(a) = 1$.)

You may take as given the following fact: with $L_t$ and $U_t$ defined as above, it holds that:

\begin{align*}
\forall a, \quad \mathbb{P}_{\theta, H}\left(\bigcup_{t=1}^T \left\{ \mu_\theta \not \in [L_t(a), U_t(a)] \right\}\right) \leq \frac{1}{T}
\end{align*}

and thus, the bound from part (b) implies:

\begin{align*}
\text{BR}_T(\pi^{TS}) \le \E_{\theta, H}\left[\sum_{t=1}^T [U_t(a_t) - L_t(a_t)]\right] + K
\end{align*}

To bound the remaining terms, let us use the decomposition $\sum_{t=1}^T [U_t(a_t) - L_t(a_t)] = \sum_a \sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}_a} [U_t(a) - L_t(a)]$, where $\mathcal{T}_a = \{t \in [T] : a_t = a\}$.

Show that:

\begin{align*}
\sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}_a} [U_t(a) - L_t(a)] \le 1 + 2 \sqrt{2 + 6 \log T} \sum_{i=1}^{n_T(a)} \frac{1}{\sqrt{i}}
\end{align*}

\textit{Hint: Consider the possible combinations $U_{t}(a)$ and $L_{t}(a)$ and how their difference guarantees the above bounded expression.}
